# Visual APL
A web based visual scripting tool for writing World of Warcraft "Action Priority Lists" to be used with [SimulationCraft](https://www.simulationcraft.org/) / [RaidBots](https://www.raidbots.com/)

This project uses a React + Vite and React Flow in java script.

## TODO
- More class/spec support
- Conditional blocks
- Auto-alignments
- Upload existing apls to visual (probably uploading plaintext)
- Instead of saving file, display plaintext APL for copy/pasting
- Sup-list support
