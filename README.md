# Visual APL
A web based visual scripting tool for writing World of Warcraft "Action Priority Lists" to be used with [SimulationCraft](https://www.simulationcraft.org/) / [RaidBots](https://www.raidbots.com/)

This project uses a React + Vite and React Flow in java script.

## TODO
- More class/spec support
- Conditional blocks (STARTED)
- Auto-alignments
- Upload existing apls to visual (probably uploading plaintext)
- Instead of saving file, display plaintext APL for copy/pasting
- Sup-list support

## Maybes
- Move class/spec selector out of the node structure and use as a "canvas" selector
- context menus for adding nodes based on selected class/spec canvas?
- sidebar based on class / spec, generate nodes based on class/spec and display them in the side bar for drag/drop instead of using a generic "ability" node
